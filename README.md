Homework #6

 This assignment was to use the GIPHY API to populate a web page with gifs of my choice. I chose the topic of cars.

Bonus items that I have implemented:

1. have the gifs play/stop based on mouse hovering, not clicks.
2. when a gif is clicked, open a modal/overlay with a larger version of the gif displayed.
3. use the bootstrap grid or flexbox to display the gifs in responsive rows.
