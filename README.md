Homework #6

 This assignment was to use the GIPHY API to populate a web page with gifs of my choice. I chose the topic of cars.

Bonus items that I have implemented:

1. Used localStorage to store new buttons created by user so buttons are not lost on page refresh.
2. Gifs play/stop based on mouse hovering, not clicks.
3. When a gif is clicked, modal opens with a larger version of the gif displayed.
4. Use the bootstrap grid to display the gifs in responsive rows.
5. List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.
